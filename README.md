## About
A 2-player tic-tac-toe game made (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as the fourth project of The Odin Project's [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) course. The player to make the first move will be randomly selected, with a message at the top of the screen indicating which player's turn it is, and whether the game has been won or ended in a tie. The navbar contains two buttons, one to change the theme and icons of the game and the other to restart the game.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- one
- two
- three
